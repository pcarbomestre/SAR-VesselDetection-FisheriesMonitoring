# Vessel detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar images using Faster R-CNN models: Advanced monitoring techniques to improve fisheries management

In this project, I developed a Faster R-CNN model to detect vessels from SAR images. The project involved comparing the model's performance by implementing various image pre-processing techniques. Furthermore, I integrated the model into an interactive report to test it with real-world Sentinel-1 data from the Copernicus Program and evaluated its potential for fisheries management through a case study.
